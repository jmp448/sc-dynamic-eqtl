This project uses single-cell RNA sequencing data to find dynamic eQTLs 

1. Cell Type Annotation
  - Code for quality control is at `tbd`
  - Code for preprocessing is at `tbd`
2. [Static eQTL Calling](static_eqtl.Rmd)
  - Code for pseudobulk aggregation (by collection day and by cell type) is at `code/pseudobulk_aggregation.R`
  - Code for eQTL calling is at `code/eqtl_static.R`
  - Code for multiple testing correction is at `code/mtc_static.R`
3. Cell Type Deconvolution
  - [Signature matrix](cell-deconvolution.Rmd) generation 
  - [Cibersort calibration](cibersort-calibration.Rmd) analysis
  - [Deconvolution results](deconvolution-results.Rmd) 
4. Trajectory Inference
  - Code for trajectory inference is at `tbd`
5. Dynamic eQTL Calling
